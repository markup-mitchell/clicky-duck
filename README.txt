clicky-duck
===========

Clicky-duck is the prototype for a web-based children's toy.

It is proof of concept for touchscreen interactions.

It **might** be developed in the following ways:

- [ ] Add different responses and randomise them on click
- [ ] Add different animals with their respective noises
- [ ] Add family members and soundboard of voice clips
- [ ] Turn into a quiz: which animal makes this sound?

etc.
